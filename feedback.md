See https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-826/project-2/blob/master/evaluation.md for description of rubric.

## Technical Requirements - Progressing

Full CRUD functionality is present on one or two models.

- Nice job on CRUD! However, your app still needs to be deployed to Heroku.

## Creativity and Interface - Performing

The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.

- It looks good in the browser! Maybe pick more interesting fonts for your app.

## Code Quality - Excelling

No major code quality issues, makes use of JS best practices appropriately, and follows techniques such as separation of concerns, abstraction, and encapsulation

- Great job separating your files into models, views and controllers!
- Make sure to remove any unneeded whitespaces (e.g., https://github.com/vbc221/Vincent-Chen-Recipe-App/blob/master/index.js)

## Functionality - Performing

Application contains no major errors.

## Planning/Process/Submission - Performing

Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues. Submission includes a readme and planning directory.

- Please make sure your readme is accurate - there are a couple of sections that still discuss your project 1 (looks like you copied and pasted your readme from project 1 but forgot to update some parts).
- Please make sure your wireframe images in your readme are oriented correctly.

## Additional Feedback

- Please configure your VSCode to automatically clean up code formatting on hitting save! It will save you a lot of time.
